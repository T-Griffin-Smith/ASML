App to demonstrate Machine Learning Models running on a mobile device.

App will contain two machine learning models. 
The first classifies goats into diseased versus non-diseased based on a photograph of their eye.
The second transcribes handwritten text based on a photograph of the text.

The machine learning models themselves are too large to include in GitHub Repo. 
Download the models from the link below and include in the same directory as the python script.
GoatEyesModel.pth: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1UrEeddj0_lEA3zVMyF0LRUeDoM2WtOFc
TextOCRModel.pth: 

I have not seen it classify any image as diseased yet.
Look into output of goat eyes ML model to determine if it is interpreting the output correctly.
